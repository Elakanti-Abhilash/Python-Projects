# 1. Simple Calculator
'''Create a game where the program randomly selects a
number between 1 and 100. The user has to guess the number. 
After each guess, the program should tell the user whether 
the guess was too low, too high, or correct. Limit the
number of guesses to 7.'''

subtraction, multiplication, and division. The 
user should enter two numbers and an operator. 
Based on the operator, the correct operation 
is performed.'''

# 3. Student Grade Checker
'''Write a program that takes marks of 5 subjects

C: 70-79
D: 60-69
F: <60'''
